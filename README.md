# Integrating_Voice_to_Mobile_Payment_Systems_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks-A_Case_of_MPESA
Performing transactions for persons without disabilities is rather easy since systems are built tailored to their needs. However, this is not the case for persons with disabilities since they have to go through a myriad of different options just to perform a simple transaction. For this reason, this project aims to develop a Mobile Application that accepts voice input, thereby allowing persons with disabilities to perform transactions independently, using the most natural form of communication: their voice.
